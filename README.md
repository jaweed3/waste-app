This project develops an AI-powered waste classification system that can categorize waste items into three classes: Organic, Recyclable, and Hazardous materials. Using computer vision and deep learning techniques, the system helps automate waste sorting processes, which can significantly improve recycling efficiency and reduce environmental impact.
