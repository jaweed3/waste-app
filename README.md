# Waste-app
This project develops an AI-powered waste classification system that can categorize waste items into three classes: Organic, Recyclable, and Hazardous materials. Using computer vision and deep learning techniques, the system helps automate waste sorting processes, which can significantly improve recycling efficiency and reduce environmental impact.
# Key Features

Multi-class Waste Classification: Identifies and categorizes waste into Organic, Recyclable, and Hazardous materials

- Transfer Learning Architecture: Leverages MobileNetV2 pre-trained model for efficient and accurate classification
- Data Augmentation: Implements image transformations to improve model robustness and generalization
- Hyperparameter Tuning: Uses Keras Tuner to optimize model architecture and training parameters
- Mobile-Ready Deployment: Converts trained model to TensorFlow Lite format for edge device deployment
# Technical Implementation
The system is built using TensorFlow and Keras, with the following components:

- Data Preparation: Downloads and processes waste classification datasets, validates image integrity, and splits data into training and testing sets
- Model Architecture: Uses MobileNetV2 as a base model with custom classification layers
- Training Pipeline: Implements data augmentation, early stopping, and learning rate optimization
- Evaluation: Measures model performance using accuracy and loss metrics
- Deployment: Converts the trained model to TensorFlow Lite for mobile/edge deployment
- Potential Applications
- Automated waste sorting facilities
- Smart recycling bins for public spaces
- Educational tools for proper waste disposal
- Environmental monitoring and compliance systems
- Mobile applications for consumer waste identification


This project contributes to sustainable waste management practices by providing an accessible, efficient way to identify and properly sort different types of waste materials.
